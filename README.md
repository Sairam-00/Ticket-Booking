This a mini microservice application which can be used to book a flight ticket.
There are two microservices in my application First one is Checking microservice, where home page is displayed and an link in the form of button, "Check you Flights".
By clicking the button we can see the flights available and then we can book ticket by clicking "Book your Ticket", then an APIURL is requested to connect with a page in other microservice, Details. In this microservice we fill credentials and confirm details . 
Then an alert will be popped up with message, "Ticket booked successfully".
